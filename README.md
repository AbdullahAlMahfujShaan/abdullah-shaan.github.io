This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases:

- **Home:** A brief introduction about myself.
- **Projects:** Detailed descriptions and case studies of my projects and work.
- **Extra Curricular Activities:** Information about my extracurricular activities and achievements.
- **Resume:** My professional resume outlining my education, skills, and experience.
- **Blog:** Articles and posts about my interests, projects, and experiences.
- **Get In Touch:** Contact form and social media links for networking.

The website is built using React for a dynamic and responsive user experience and is deployed on GitHub Pages.

Feel free to explore the code, give suggestions, or reach out to me via the contact section on the website. Thank you for visiting!
